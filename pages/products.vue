              Connectivo was founded in 2013 and spent the first 4 years of
              trade in e-commerce, selling in a variety of countries and
              marketplaces. We found early on a variety of friction points and
              time-consuming manual steps which prevented us from realizing the
              target goals. With every problem, a bigger solution can be found.
              After some years of frustration, we decided to drop what we were
              doing and get to the root of the problem.

              With a background in IT, accounting, e-commerce, finance and
              business development we merged all experiences together and
              started designing and coding software solutions to help push
              entrepreneurs forward. Today, Connectivo provides standardized
              apps and platforms that solve common problems within a variety of
              industries.
              <br />
              The company is 100% founder-owned, profitable, and fully
              bootstrapped. This allows us to continuously put our clients'
              needs above all without compromising on quality, mission, or
              vision.
